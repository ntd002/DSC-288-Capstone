To replicate our process, start in the folder "Milestone 2: 1st Progress Report."
In folder "Step 1: Scraping Reddit," the notebook "DSC_288_Reddit_Scraping" details how to acquire the scraped data "DSC 288 Raw Reddit Dataset."
In folder "Step 2: Preprocessing Data," the notebook "DSC_288_Preprocessing" converts the raw dataset into the processed dataset "DSC 288 Processed Reddit Dataset."
In folder "Step 3: Initial Modeling," the notebook "DSC_288_EDA" performs exploratory data analysis on the preprocessed dataset. The other files are the progress report and a quick model to make sure the dataset is in good shape.

Leaving the "Milestone 2" folder, the "Milestone 3: 2nd Progress Report" folder contains our two main modeling notebooks, "DSC_288_MultinomialNB_Optimization" and "DSC_288_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation." Both take in the preprocessed dataset. It also contains our progress report slides.
