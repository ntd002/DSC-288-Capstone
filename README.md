# DSC-288-Capstone
This GitHub is a collection of our work throughout this quarter.
<br />All notebooks can be run in Google Colab after uploading the required dataset.

The Team Contract and Project Abstract are self-explanatory.

"Milestone 2: 1st Progress Report" contains all coding related to that including:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"Step 1: Scraping Reddit" includes code for accessing Reddit's API and assembling the raw dataset.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"Step 2: Preprocessing Data" includes code for preprocessing the raw data into a dataset we would use from here on out.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"Step 3: Initial Modeling" includes an early Multinomial Naive Bayes model, Exploratory Data Analysis, and our 1st Progress Report.

"Milestone 3: 2nd Progress Report" includes:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"DSC_288_MultinomialNB_Optimization" notebook which is a more up to date and optimized model.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"DSC_288_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation" notebook which is the attempt to use LDA modeling.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The PDF version of the 2nd Progress Report powerpoint.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The video presentation is not here as there was trouble uploading a file of that size.

"Milestone 4: Final Report" contains the most up to date models used in our final report:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"DSC_288_MultinomialNB_Final" and "DSC_288_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_Final" have extra metrics added and some new plots compared to previous iterations.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The LDA model may take upwards of 30 minutes to run.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"DSC_288_Application" is a barebones attempt at creating a recommendation tool.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-After adding the dataset, one could type into the question variable and receive a couple mental health website recommendations.
